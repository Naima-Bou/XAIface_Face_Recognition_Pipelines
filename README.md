 Measuring and Improving Explainability for AI-based Face Recognition 
</h2>

## 1. Introduction
This Github repository offers the deep face recognition pipelines selected to be considered to work on in the the [XAIface](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chistera-xaiface-6a3478219/?originalSubdomain=fr) project. These face recognition pipelines include `RetinaFace`  for face detection, `ArcFace`  and `MagFace` for face recognition.

This Github repository is inspired by the source codes and face recognition and detection models available at [InsightFace](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface) and [MagFace](https://github.com/IrvingMeng/MagFace) Github projects.

- For face detection task, please refer to: [Face Detection](https://github.com/IrvingMeng/MagFace).
